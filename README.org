* Introduction

  The rfc-docs is a Emacs major mode to browse/search/read
  RFCs (text) documents.

* Motivation

  The original =rfc-mode= package has as dependency the
  =helm= package witch a lot of people (including me) don't
  use, so this is just a simplification using the builtin
  functionalities (=completions, minibuffer=) provided by
  =Vanilla Emacs=.

  See ~./assets/fullscreen.png~ for more information.

* Dependencies

  - Emacs >= 26.3 (tested on)

* Installation
** Cask

   Add =rfc-docs= git repository to the Cask file:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   (depends-on "rfc-docs"
               :git "https://github.com/esac-io/rfc-docs")

   #+END_SRC

   And run cask Install command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   $ cask install

   #+END_SRC

** Manually

   Clone this repository to any arbitrary location, e.g:
   =~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/rfc-docs=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   $ git clone https://github.com/esac-io/rfc-docs ~/.emacs.d/site-elisp/rfc-docs

   #+END_SRC

* Configure
** Enables

   Add the following snippet of code to you Emacs initialization file
   (usually ~init.el~).

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   ;; require rfc-docs feature (load it)
   (require 'rfc-docs nil t)

   #+END_SRC

   Note: For a more dynamic approach uses =load-file= or
         =load-library= functions, i.e, =M-x load-library RET rfc-docs RET=.

** Download RFCs (Optional)

   Download RFC archive and decompress it at some
   arbitrary folder, beware though, =`rfc-docs-directory'= as
   to point to this directory, e.g:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   $ cd ~/.emacs.d/rfc
   $ fetch https://www.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/tar/RFC-all.tar.gz
   $ tar -zxvf RFC-all.tar.gz

   #+END_SRC

   If you prefer to download one file at time, just use
   =M-x rfc-docs-search= select RFC number candidate and it
   will be downloaded and saved automatically at =`rfc-docs-directory'=.

   Note:  =`rfc-docs-directory'= default value is =~/.emacs.d/rfc/=

** Customize

   Use emacs customize interface to see what options/values
   are available =M-x customize-group RET rfc-docs=.

* Usage

  Search for a RFC with the =M-x rfc-docs-search= function,
  after a RFC was selected a new buffer with its contents will
  be created. Inside rfc-docs buffer use =<prior>= / =<next>=
  binded to =rfc-docs-forward-page= / =rfc-docs-backward-page=
  to move around.

  - Note: Default movement keybinds will work just fine, but
    optionally =SPC= can be used to forward a page.

  - OBS: The buffer is read-only to avoid messing with
    the original RFC content.

* Future

  - Integrate with =request= or =async-copy-file=,
    and a write functions to download (from a remote source)
    and decompress RFCs from archive.
