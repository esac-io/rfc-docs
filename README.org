#+DESCRIPTION: An Emacs major mode to browse RFC documents
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle no

* Introduction

  The rfc-docs is an Emacs major mode to browse, search and read
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments][RFC]] documents.

* Motivation

  Simplify =rfc-mode= source code to use =vanilla Emacs=
  functionalities (=completions=, =minibuffer=) and
  remove =helm= dependency.

* Screenshot

  See ~./assets/fullscreen.png~ for more information.

* Dependencies

  - seq
  - cl-macs
  - text-mode

* Tested on

  - Emacs >= 26.3

* Installation
** Manually

   Clone =rfc-docs= repository to a arbitrary location:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   $ git clone https://github.com/esac-io/rfc-docs ~/.emacs.d/site-elisp/rfc-docs

   #+END_SRC

   Add =rfc-docs= directory to =load-path= in your Emacs
   initialization file (~init.el~) and load it.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   ;; add to load-path
   (add-to-list 'load-path "/replace/me/to/rfc-docs/path")

   ;; load rfc-docs feature
   (require 'rfc-docs nil t)

   #+END_SRC

   - Note: For a more dynamic approach uses:
     - =M-x load-file RET=
     - =M-x load-library RET rfc-docs RET=

* Usage

  Search for a =RFC= with the =M-x rfc-docs-search= function,
  enter/select a =RFC number= in the minibuffer prompt, a new
  buffer =*rfc<number>*= will be created with the =RFC number=
  contents.

  Inside =*rfc<number>*= buffer uses =<next>=, =<prior>= to
  forward/backward a page, =SPC= also can be used
  to forward a page.

  - Default movement keybinds works as usual.
  - The buffer is read-only to avoid messing with
    the original RFC content.

* Binds

  The table below describes =rfc-docs-keymap=:

  | key     | function               | description   |
  | q       | rfc-docs-quit          | quit window   |
  | SPC     | rfc-docs-forward-page  | forward page  |
  | <next>  | rfc-docs-forward-page  | forward page  |
  | <prior> | rfc-docs-backward-page | backward page |
  Table 1.0 =rfc-docs-keymap=

* Download RFCs

  - Note: This is totally optional.

  Download RFC archive and decompress it at =rfc-docs-directory=
  pointer location.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh

  $ cd ~/.emacs.d/rfc
  $ fetch https://www.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/tar/RFC-all.tar.gz
  $ tar -zxvf RFC-all.tar.gz

  #+END_SRC

  - Note: =rfc-docs-directory= default value: =~/.emacs.d/rfc/=

* Customize

  =M-x customize-group RET rfc-docs=

* Future

  1. Integrate with =request= or =async-copy-file= packages, write
     functions to download RFC compressed archive and to decompress
     it.
  2. Make index links to provide jumps.
