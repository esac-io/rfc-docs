* Introduction

  The rfc-mode Emacs major mode to search and reader
  for RFC txt documents.

* Motivation

  The original rfc-mode has as its dependencies the
  =helm package= witch a lot of people (including me) don't
  use, so this is just a simplification.

  See ~./assets/fullscreen.png~ for more information.

* Dependencies

  - Emacs >= 26.3 (tested on)

* Installation
** Cask

   Add =rfc-mode= git repository to the Cask file:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   (depends-on "rfc-mode"
               :git "https://github.com/esac-io/rfc-mode")

   #+END_SRC

   Install with cask:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   $ cask install

   #+END_SRC

   Add the following to your .emacs/init.el:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   (require 'rfc-mode)

   #+END_SRC

** Manually

   Clone this repository to ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/async-copy-file.
   Add the following to your .emacs/init.el:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   ;; add to load path
   (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/rfc-mode"))

   ;; require the feature
   (require 'rfc-mode)

   #+END_SRC

** Download all RFC (Optional)

   Seep up the process of find and open RFCs text files by download
   then. Download RFC archive and decompress it at some
   arbitrary folder, beware though, =`rfc-mode-directory= as
   to point to this directory (default value: ~~/.emacs.d/rfc~),
   e.g:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   $ cd ~/.emacs.d/rfc
   $ fetch https://www.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/tar/RFC-all.tar.gz
   $ tar -zxvf RFC-all.tar.gz

   #+END_SRC

   If you prefer to download one file at time, just use =M-x
   rfc-mode-browse= select RFC number candidate and it will be downloaded
   and saved automatically at =`rfc-mode-directory=.

** Customize

   Use emacs customize interface to see what options/values
   are available =M-x customize-group RET rfc-mode=.

* Usage

  Search for a RFC with the =M-x rfc-mode-browse= function,
  after a RFC as selected a new buffer with its contents will
  be created. Inside rfc-mode buffer use =<prior>= / =<next>=
  binded to =rfc-mode-forward-page= / =rfc-mode-backward-page=
  to move around.

  - Note: Default movement keybinds will work fine, but
    optionally =SPC= can be used to forward a page.

  - OBS: The buffer is read-only to avoid messing with
    the original RFC content.

* Future

  - Integrate with `request or async-copy-file package,
    and a write functions to download (from a remote source)
    and decompress RFCs from archive.

  Everyone, deep in their hearts, is waiting
  for the end of the world to come.
